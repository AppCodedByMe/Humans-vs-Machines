Your response goes here!

1. What new skills have you learned?
 

I have learned how to properly structure an HTML form, I have learned how to mark up text via hyperlink, emphasis, strong (bold), subscript, etc. I can look at a simple HTML document and recreate it. It have learned how to use pictures in my sites via url or images downloaded to my computer, etc.

2. What has been easy?
  
Most of it has been easy, I always have to lookup how to properly format the <a> tag for hyperlinking, but at least with MDN, I have a better or more organized resource than W3 schools, which is where I used to go before I enrolled in this course.

3. What has been difficult?
  
Up until this point, nothing has been particularly "difficult."


4. How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?



My basic problem solving strategy is what it always has been since Google became a populat search engine, I'll Google a question, and so far it brings me right to the MDN link. If that doesn't work, I'll scour the Internet for he answers, or I'll post to the discussion group, or hit up Stack Overflow.
